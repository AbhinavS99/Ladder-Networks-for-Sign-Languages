# Ladder-Networks-for-Sign-Languages
<h2>Ladder Networks</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify">Ladder networks are an amalgamation of supervised and unsupervised learning in deep neural networks. In ladder networks, both the supervised and the unsupervised components are trained simultaneously to minimize the sum of the supervised and unsupervised cost functions by backpropagation, avoiding the need of layer-wise pre-training. Ladder networks achieve state of the art performance in semi-supervised MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifications.</div>
